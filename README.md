# Gps-tracker

### About the app
Hybrid android app used to track multiple GPS devices _(See the screenshots below)_assembled on your cars,motorbikes,child,elderly
or anything you'd like to keep your eyes on.It uses sms and telephony to connect to its registered gps devices.Once a device is 
registered and turned on, the user can start tracking that device with just a single touch.This app is the result of an attempt
to eleminate all those tedious procedures required to interact with gps devices assembled.
> To see how tedious the procedures are,
have a look at the basic workflow of the gps used along with this app.
