#### About the app
Hybrid android app used to track multiple GPS devices _(See the screenshots below)_assembled on your cars,motorbikes,child,elderly
or anything you'd like to keep your eyes on.It uses sms and telephony to connect to its registered gps devices.Once a device is 
registered and turned on, the user can start tracking that device with just a single touch.This app is the result of an attempt
to eleminate all those tedious procedures required to interact with gps devices assembled.
> To see how tedious the procedures are,
have a look at the basic workflow of the gps used along with this app.

*_Gps device used along with this app_s
This device can be easily avialable in the market with a fair price of somewhere around `25 US $`. It is designed to be tracked from a mobile phone capable of displaying the gps location on a google map. Sms and telephony is used as a way of interacting between the gps and the handheld device.With a GSM simcard embeded inside, the simcard's number is used as the gps's identity which is also the target address to which sms & telephony interactions are performed.
